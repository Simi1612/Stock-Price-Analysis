# Stock-Price-Analysis

📈 Stock Price Prediction & Analysis Web App
🔥 Powered by LSTM Deep Learning Model + Flask

This project is an end-to-end Stock Price Prediction and Analysis Web Application that uses a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to forecast stock trends based on historical market data.
It also visualizes essential technical indicators such as EMA 20, 50, 100, 200 and generates Actual vs Predicted graphs.

Built using: Python, Flask, Keras, yFinance, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
Team Members: Rani Amin, Smruti Katariya

🚀 Features

✔ Fetches real-time stock data using yFinance
✔ LSTM-based future stock price prediction
✔ EMA trend visualization (20, 50, 100, 200)
✔ Actual vs Predicted graph comparison
✔ Auto-generates downloadable CSV file
✔ Clean, simple, user-friendly web interface
✔ Flask-based backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend
✔ Error handling for invalid stock symbols

🧩 How the Model Works

The LSTM model was trained on:

10 years of stock price data

Closing price as the primary feature

100-day historical window

MinMax scaled dataset

70% training, 30% testing

The trained model predicts future values which are then inverse-scaled to actual prices.

🌟 Future Enhancements

🚀 Add RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
🚀 Add multi-stock comparison dashboard
🚀 Deploy the app on Render / Railway / AWS
🚀 Add Buy/Sell/Hold suggestion system
🚀 Build a React or Streamlit frontend
